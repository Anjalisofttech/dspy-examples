- Linear Layer Models (llm)
- Python Programming

## Code Samples:
Here are a few code snippets showcasing the use of DSPy functionalities:

```python
import dspy

# Create a linear layer model
model = dspy.LinearModel(input_dim=10, output_dim=1)

# Load data
X_train, y_train = dspy.load_data('train.csv')

# Train the model
model.train(X_train, y_train)
```

## Examples:
The repository includes various examples such as:
- Image processing using DSPy
- Time-series analysis with DSPy
- Digital filter design
- Machine learning algorithms in DSPy

Feel free to explore the codebase and learn from these practical examples.
